  <long_description>ScummVM is a program which allows you to run many classic graphical adventure and role-playing games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed\!

Supported games include LucasArts SCUMM games (Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Sam &amp; Max...), many of Sierra's AGI and SCI games (King's Quest, Space Quest, Quest for Glory...), and games such as Discworld, Simon the Sorcerer, Beneath A Steel Sky, Lure of the Temptress, Broken Sword, Flight of the Amazon Queen, Gobliiins, The Legend of Kyrandia, Eye of the Beholder, Myst, Riven, many of Humongous Entertainment's children's SCUMM games (including the Freddi Fish and Putt Putt games), and many more. You can find a full list with details on which adventures are supported and how well on the compatibility page. ScummVM is continually improving, so check back often.</long_description>
